## Entity-Relationship Model (ERM):

1. **User**: This entity represents the users of your application. It already exists in your current implementation.
   - Attributes: id (UUID), username, email, password_hash

2. **ShoppingList**: This entity represents the shopping lists that users create.
   - Attributes: id (UUID), title, created_at, updated_at
   - Relationships: Each shopping list is owned by one user (owner/administrator).

3. **Collaboration**: This entity represents the many-to-many relationship between users and shopping lists, indicating which users are collaborating on which lists.
   - Attributes: user_id (UUID, FK), shopping_list_id (UUID, FK)

4. **ListItem**: This entity represents the items within each shopping list.
   - Attributes: id (UUID), shopping_list_id (UUID, FK), item_name, quantity, unit_of_measurement, checked (boolean)

## API Implementation:

1. **Create and Delete Lists**: 
   - Endpoint to create a list (`POST /shopping_lists`) should require the list title and associate it with the authenticated user.
   - Endpoint to delete a list (`DELETE /shopping_lists/<list_id>`) should only be accessible by the list's owner.

2. **Add and Remove Collaborators**:
   - Endpoint to add a collaborator (`POST /shopping_lists/<list_id>/collaborators`) should accept the user's identifier and associate it with a list.
   - Endpoint to remove a collaborator (`DELETE /shopping_lists/<list_id>/collaborators/<user_id>`) should disassociate a user from the list.

3. **View Lists**:
   - Endpoint to get all lists for a user (`GET /shopping_lists`) should return both owned and collaborated lists.

4. **Add and Check-off Items**:
   - Endpoint to add an item to a list (`POST /shopping_lists/<list_id>/items`) should accept item details and associate them with a list.
   - Endpoint to check off an item during shopping (`PUT /shopping_lists/<list_id>/items/<item_id>`) should update the item's checked status.

## Flutter Application Integration:

1. **User Interface**: 
   - Implement screens to create and view shopping lists, add collaborators, and manage list items.
   - Provide real-time feedback as users collaborate on lists.

2. **State Management**:
   - Use a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc) to manage and update the UI based on the current state of lists and items.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Use the `ApiService` class to interact with your Flask API endpoints for managing shopping lists and items.
   - Ensure proper authentication is passed along with each request.

4. **User Experience**:
   - Ensure that changes made by collaborators are reflected in real-time or updated periodically.
   - Allow users to easily join, leave, and interact with their shopping lists.
